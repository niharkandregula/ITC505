<h3>SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter ROMEO</i>
</blockquote>

<b>ROMEO</b>
<blockquote>
Can I go forward when my heart is here?<br>
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.<br>
<p><i>He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it</i></p>
<p><i>Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO</i></p>
</blockquote>

<b>BENVOLIO</b>
<blockquote>
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!<br>
</blockquote>

<b>MERCUTIO</b>
<blockquote>
He is wise;<br>
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>BENVOLIO</b>
<blockquote>
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:<br>
Call, good Mercutio.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>MERCUTIO</b>
<blockquote>
Nay, I'll conjure too.<br>
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!<br>
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:<br>
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;<br>
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'<br>
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,<br>
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,<br>
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,<br>
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!<br>
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;<br>
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.<br>
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,<br>
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,<br>
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh<br>
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,<br>
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!<br>
</blockquote>

<b>BENVOLIO</b>
<blockquote>
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>MERCUTIO</b>
<blockquote>
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him<br>
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle<br>
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand<br>
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;<br>
That were some spite: my invocation<br>
Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name<br>
I conjure only but to raise up him.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>BENVOLIO</b>
<blockquote>
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,<br>
To be consorted with the humorous night:<br>
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>MERCUTIO</b>
<blockquote>
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.<br>
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,<br>
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit<br>
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.<br>
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were<br>
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!<br>
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;<br>
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:<br>
Come, shall we go?<br>
</blockquote>

<b>BENVOLIO</b>
<blockquote>
Go, then; for 'tis in vain<br>
To seek him here that means not to be found.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>

    <P>
      Certainly! Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the tags used in the provided HTML code:

<p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</code> declares the document type and version of HTML, ensuring that the browser correctly renders the page.</p>
 <p><code>&lt;html&gt;</code> is the root element that encapsulates all the content on the page.</p> 
<p><code>&lt;head&gt;</code> contains meta-information about the document, including its title and character set.</p> 
<p><code>&lt;title&gt;</code> specifies the title of the web page, which appears in the browser tab.</p> 
<p><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> defines metadata, in this case, specifying the character encoding used for the document.</p>
 <p><code>&lt;body&gt;</code> represents the main content of the document that will be visible to users.</p> 
<p><code>&lt;table&gt;</code> creates a table for organizing content, and its attributes define the width and background color.</p>
 <p><code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> defines a row within a table.</p> <p><code>&lt;td&gt;</code> represents a cell within a table row, containing content such as text or links.</p> 
<p><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> creates a hyperlink, allowing users to navigate to other web pages or sections.</p>

<p><code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> is a header tag that defines a third-level heading, used for titles and subheadings.</p> 
<p><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> creates a paragraph, organizing text into separate blocks.</p>
 <p><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> is used for quoting blocks of text, often indented from the rest of the content.</p> 
<p><code>&lt;i&gt;</code> italicizes text, typically used for emphasis or titles.</p>
 <p><code>&lt;b&gt;</code> bolds text to give it more prominence.</p>
 <p><code>&lt;table&gt;</code> appears again for a second table, with similar functions and attributes as the first.</p>
 <p><code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> marks the end of the HTML document.</p>
 Each tag plays a crucial role in structuring the content, making it easier for both browsers and users to interpret and interact with the page.
